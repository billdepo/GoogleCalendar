# GoogleCalendar
Google Calendar events generation code using Google Scripts

In this project, we have imported all the Scheduled Dates and Times for the Academy "Code.Hub - Project Future 5 ReGeneration Academy - Business Intelligence & Analytics" into a Google Script which automated then the task of creating events into a specific Google Calendar.

At the end, we can share our calendar to the rest of the Academy's participants :)
